It attracted the attention of numerous writers across the century ([Read More](19c-kent))

## Broadstairs

[Broadstairs](/dickens/broadstairs-19th-century)

![](https://iiif.juncture-digital.org/thumbnail?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kent-map/images/main/dickens/Broadstairs_c13874-68.jpg)

Despite being the favoured holiday destination of no less a figure than Charles Dickens, Broadstairs never aimed to compete with either the much-vaunted gentility of Ramsgate or the mass appeal of Margate.

## Canterbury

[Canterbury](19c-canterbury)

![](https://iiif.juncture-digital.org/thumbnail?url=https://stor.artstor.org/stor/0f2de866-06f5-4ffa-a17b-bdf59b8003f2)

One of the more surprising features of Canterbury is that, despite the cathedral being the home of the Church of England, no Archbishop of Canterbury was enthroned there until John Bird Sumner in 1848.

## Chatham Dockyard

[Chatham Dockyard](19c-chatham-dockyard)

![](https://iiif.juncture-digital.org/thumbnail?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Joseph_Farington_%281747-1821%29_-_Chatham_Dockyard_-_BHC1782_-_Royal_Museums_Greenwich.jpg)

The 19th century saw Chatham Dockyard rise to a pre-eminent position among naval dockyards, with its prime location and key participation in the Industrial Revolution.

## Dover

[Dover](19c-dover)

![](https://iiif.juncture-digital.org/thumbnail?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kent-map/images/main/dickens/Dover_Castle.jpg)

Like Ramsgate, Dover considered itself to be among the more genteel of the 19th century seaside resorts but it could not avoid rackety associations altogether.

## Folkestone

[Folkestone](19c-folkestone)

![](https://iiif.juncture-digital.org/thumbnail?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Lee%27s_Promenade_and_Bandstand%2C_Folkestone%2C_England-LCCN2002696748.jpg)

As one 19th century wag observed, Folkestone is a near anagram of ‘Kent Fools’, a joke not lost on the unknown author (believed to be from Dover) of The Folkestone Fiery Serpent.

## Folkestone Free Library

[Folkestone Free Library](19c-folkestone-free-library)

![](https://iiif.juncture-digital.org/thumbnail?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Canterbury_Library_main_entrance.jpg)

Whilst the Libraries Act of 1850 enabled the provision of public libraries through the rates, provincial towns were unaccountably reluctant, in short -  as Mr Micawber might have put it - they were slow to act.

## Gravesend

[Gravesend](19c-gravesend)

![](https://iiif.juncture-digital.org/thumbnail?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Grand_Entrance_to_Gravesend_Cemetery_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1096043.jpg)

In the nineteenth century, steamboats sailing to Gravesend transferred an influx of tourists to Rosherville Gardens, a Victorian pleasure garden built within an abandoned chalk pit owned by Jeremiah Rosher.

## Margate

[Margate](19c-margate)

![](https://iiif.juncture-digital.org/thumbnail?url=https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/image/L0017751/full/full/0/default.jpg)

The ‘modesty hood’, designed to screen naked bathers as they descended the steps of their horse-powered bathing machines, was invented in Margate in 1753.

## Ramsgate

[Ramsgate](19c-ramsgate)

![](https://iiif.juncture-digital.org/thumbnail?url=https://stor.artstor.org/stor/811dfc80-b02e-4166-a487-02892f44e4c5)

‘Royal Ramsgate’, so-called because Princess Victoria had spent holidays there in 1835 and 1836, largely succeeded in distancing itself from its more louche counterpart Margate in the popular imagination.

## Rosherville

[Rosherville](19c-rosherville)

![](https://iiif.juncture-digital.org/thumbnail?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Rosherville_Gardens_in_Kent.jpg)

Rosherville Gardens, a long-forgotten pleasure garden built in an abandoned chalk pit in Kent in 1830, was a popular tourist attraction in the nineteenth century. 

## Sandgate

[Sandgate](/placesqz/sandgate-overview)

![](https://iiif.juncture-digital.org/thumbnail?url=https://stor.artstor.org/stor/04780929-4966-4142-b325-12a69d7ab094)

Sandgate, a coastal village near the outskirts of Folkestone, has been hailed as the 'author's haven of repose' and can claim association with several well-known authors.

## Seaside Resorts

[Seaside resorts](19c-seaside)

![](https://iiif.juncture-digital.org/thumbnail?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kent-map/images/main/19c/Margate_from_the_Parade.jpg)

As the fashionable ‘water cure’ of spas such as Bath and Tunbridge Wells moved coastwards in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, so a number of obscure fishing villages reinvented themselves as seaside resorts.

## Contagious Diseases Acts

[Contagious Diseases Acts](19c-contagious-diseases)

![](https://iiif.juncture-digital.org/thumbnail?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/RochesterStBarts4245.JPG)

Parliament passed the Contagious Diseases Act in 1864 (amended in 1866 and 1869). The act was specifically targeted at ports and garrison towns with, unsurprisingly, Chatham qualifying as both.

## Hoodening

[Hoodening](19c-hoodening)

![](https://iiif.juncture-digital.org/thumbnail?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clb953/KMOfullcopy3004images/main/19c/images/Hoodeners.jpg)

Traditionally, hoodening has taken place mainly around the Thanet, Deal and Canterbury areas. In 1839, a Hooden Horse in Broadstairs so frightened a lady that she collapsed and died.

## Jewish Emancipation

[Jewish Emancipation](19c-jewish-emancipation)

![](https://iiif.juncture-digital.org/thumbnail?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Rochester_Castle_engraved_by_H.Adlard_after_G.F.Sargent._c1836_edited.jpg)

In 1829 the Roman Catholic Relief Act left only Jews excluded from politics by their faith and a campaign for equal rights, which was to last for decades, began.

## Leather and Dust

[Leather and Dust](/dickens/19c-leather-and-dust)

David Copperfield's curated walk can tell us much about the route he follows from London. Maps can show us the route, but what of the road itself?

## Miss Balmaine's Past

[Miss Balmaine's Past by Bithia Croker](19c-croker-missbalmaine)

![](https://iiif.juncture-digital.org/thumbnail?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/The_description_of_Romney_Marsh_RMG_K1030-001.jpg/800px-The_description_of_Romney_Marsh_RMG_K1030-001.jpg)

‘Horton’ a thinly veiled New Romney is the setting for Bithia Mary Croker’s 1898 novel Miss Balmaine’s Past. The novel paints a dismal portrait of Horton: “no shopping, no lending library – not even a clothing club.”

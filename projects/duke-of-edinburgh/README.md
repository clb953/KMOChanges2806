May Aldington wrote _Meg of the Salt Pans_ set in a Kentish village near Sandport (Sandwich). The book draws on her own experiences living at the _Bell and Anchor_ in Sandwich. May was praised for her 'excellent pen pictures of Kentish people â€” people that we seem to know without being able to actually recognise'.
